## 📌 Business Context

ShopSense is a D2C cosmetics e-commerce store — a portfolio case built on a
**GA4-style ecommerce events dataset (~20.7M rows)**. As a Data Analyst,
I investigated why users drop off between **product view and first purchase**, and
why retention is low after the first order. *(All revenue figures are in USD, as
per the source dataset.)*

## ❓ Business Questions Answered

1. Where exactly are users dropping off in the purchase funnel?
2. What is our Day 1, Day 7, and Day 30 retention rate?
3. What is the Monthly Active User (MAU) trend over 5 months?
4. What is the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)?
5. Which product categories drive the most conversions?

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **The funnel leaks at the top, not at checkout.** Only **24.9%** of viewers add to cart and just **6.9%** ever purchase — the biggest loss is awareness→intent.
- **Cart abandonment is the #1 revenue leak.** **72.5%** of users who add to cart never buy.
- **Revenue is promotion-driven and volatile.** Month-over-month swing from **+26%** (Nov) to **−29.6%** (Dec).
- **Value is highly concentrated.** **14,139 "Champion" users (13% of buyers)** average **$215** each, while **59% of buyers are "At Risk."**
- **Best conversion window is 9 AM–1 PM** (~6% vs ~3.5% overnight) — a free lever for promo timing.

**Scale:** 20.7M events · 1.6M users · 110,518 buyers · $6.35M revenue · ARPU $57.47.
